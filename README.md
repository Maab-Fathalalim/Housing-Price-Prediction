# Housing-Price-Predictionüè†

## Project Overview
---
Interested in understanding what drives housing prices? I've conducted an analysis using linear regression to predict home prices based on several key factors. These include the number 
of bedrooms and bathrooms, the number of stories, proximity to main roads, and the presence of guest rooms, basements, hot water heating, air conditioning, parking, preferred areas, and 
   furnishing status.

## Problem Statement
  Consider a real estate company that has a dataset containing the prices of properties in the Delhi region. It wishes to use the data to
  optimise the sale prices of the properties based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc. Essentially, the company
  wants to identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
  To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables such as number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
  To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.

## Data Sources
  [Housing Dataset.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset)

## Tools
  Jupyter

## Data cleaning 
  Find duplicates and null values to process them.
  Encoding some columns so I can use them in forecasting.

 
## Data Analysis
  Include some code with python libraries like
  
pandas 

numpy

matplotlib 

sklearn

sklearn.metrics

sklearn.linear_model

train_test_split

## Results 
  With this analysis, we were able to build a model that predicts house prices with an accuracy of 61%
